# Project Constitution

This document defines the **absolute rules** that govern the development and maintenance of this project. All contributors (humans and AI) must adhere to these rules without exception.

## Article I. Separation of Concerns
1.  **External Specifications**: The requirements, domain logic, and API designs for this project are strictly defined in an **external repository**.
2.  **No Spec Commits**: You **MUST NEVER** commit the contents of the `sdd-examination-spec` folder (or any other path containing the specs) to this repository. The specification repository must remain a separate entity to prevent data duplication and versioning conflicts.
3.  **Git Ignore & Verification**: 
    *   The symbolic link `sdd-examination-spec` must always be present in `.gitignore`.
    *   **Pre-Commit Check**: Before running `git add .`, you MUST check `git status` to ensure `sdd-examination-spec` is NOT being tracked or staged. If it appears as `modified` or `new file`, you MUST untrack it (`git rm --cached sdd-examination-spec`) immediately.

## Article II. Specification-Driven Development (SDD)
1.  **Spec First**: Implementation code shall not be written until a corresponding specification exists.
2.  **Single Source of Truth**: When ambiguity arises in the code, the Specification is the final authority. Do not change the code to fit assumptions; verify the Spec first.
3.  **Verification**: Code changes must be verified against the rules defined in the Specification.

## Article III. Data Privacy & Security
1.  **No Database Commits**: Production or local development tokens, secrets, and **database files** (*.db, *.sqlite, etc.) must **NEVER** be committed to the repository.
2.  **Ignored Data**: The `data/` directory is reserved for local persistence and must remain in `.gitignore`.

## Article IV. AI Assistant Guidelines
1.  **Read-Only Specs**: AI assistants may read `sdd-examination-spec` to understand requirements but must **never** attempt to modify files within that directory unless explicitly instructed to update the *Specification Repository* itself.
2.  **Cross-Language Implementation**: While specifications may be written in Korean (or other languages), the implementation code (variables, comments, commit messages) must be written in **English**.
3.  **Sensitive Content Verification**: Before creating or editing files likely to contain secrets (e.g., config files, `.env`, test data), AI assistants MUST pause and explicitly ask the USER for review to ensure no actual secret keys are being hardcoded or committed.
4.  **Documentation Language**: The `README.md` and other project documentation in this repository must be maintained in **English** to serve as an efficient entry point for AI assistants. This allows AIs to quickly understand the project structure and navigate to the specifications (which may be in other languages) without context switching overhead.

## Article IV. Amendments
1.  **User Confirmation Required**: Any changes to this **CONSTITUTION.md** file require explicit approval from the USER. AI assistants must not modify this file without a direct request or confirmation.
